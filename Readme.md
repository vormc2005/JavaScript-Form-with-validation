JavaScript form with validation
As a user, I would like to have a form that takes a User name, E-mail, password, and password confirmation inputs. For needs to validate all of the inputs to make sure that username and passwords are a certain length, e-mail is in an appropriate format, and passwords inputs match.

This if Vanilla JavaScript form that implements validations. It can be used as a boilerplate for other forms of design needs. This form validates length, format, and type of inputs and outputs error if there is one, or lets you know that form inputs are successful.
